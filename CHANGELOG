NDN-CPP v0.8 (2015-09-24)
-------------------------

Changes
* In security, added KeyChain::createIdentityAndCertificate which returns the
  certificate name, instead of the deprecated createIdentity which returns the
  key name.
* Added ThreadsafeFace, AsyncTcpTransport and AsyncUnixTransport which use
  Boost's asio io_service which handles all the async operations so that your
  application doesn't need to call processEvents.
* In security ConfigPolicyManager, added load(input, inputName) to read
  configuration rules from a string.
* In examples, added test-get-async-threadsafe which uses ThreadsafeFace and
  doesn't call processEvents. To run, you must install Boost with asio.
* In Face.registerPrefix, removed deprecated support to register with NDNx.
* In Interest, removed deprecated NDNx get/setPublisherPublicKeyDigest,
  get/setScope and get/setAnswerOriginKind.
* In Sha256WithRsaSignature, removed deprecated NDNx get/setPublisherPublicKeyDigest,

NDN-CPP v0.7 (2015-05-13)
-------------------------

Changes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2624 By default, throw an exception when
  using the deprecated NDNx and binary XML wire format. To enable support while
  you upgrade your code to use NFD, in your main application set
  WireFormat::ENABLE_NDNX = true
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2388 Moved example programs from "tests" to "examples".
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1921 In Face, added getMaxNdnPacketSize().
  expressInterest and putData throw an exception if the encoded packet size exceeds it.
* Renamed KEY_TYPE_EC to KEY_TYPE_ECDSA.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2566 In Face, added setInterestFilter. In
  registerPrefix, make the onInterest callback optional.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2579 Added callback type OnInterestCallback
  to use in registerPrefix and setInterestFilter instead of OnInterest. The new
  callback is passed the Face so that you can supply the Data with face.putData().
* Face: Changed the OnInterest callback to pass interestFilterId instead of registeredPrefixId.
  (You should use OnInterestCallback instead of the deprecated OnInterest.)
* MemoryContentCache: In registerPrefix, changed the onDataNotFound to OnInterestCallback.
  If your application uses onDataNotFound, you must update your callback function.
* In KeyChain::createIdentity, added an optional KeyParams argument.
* In Interest setter methods, return this so that you can chain calls to update values.
* In configure, only link to the Boost regex library if HAVE_STD_REGEX==0.
* Added class util/SegmentFetcher, ported from ndn-cxx. Use it in examples test-list-rib.
* Added the public NDN-CPP Lite API in include/ndn-cpp/lite. See README-NDN-CPP-Lite.md.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2532#change-8836 In Face.registerPrefix,
  if connected to a remote NFD then use localhop to do remote registration. (For
  remote registration, the remote NFD must be configured for localhop_security.)
  Added the optional method Face.isLocal() for the application to check if the
  connection is local.
* In MemoryContentCache, added support for storePendingInterest. add(data) will
  check if the added Data packet satisfies any pending interest. You can use
  getStorePendingInterest() for onDataNotFound in registerPrefix().
* In ControlParameters, added support for Uri and Strategy.
* In TlvWireFormat, implemented decodeControlParameters.
* examples: Added test-list-channels, test-list-faces, test-list-rib and
  test-register-route to query NFD.
* examples: In repo-ng added basic-insertion and watched-insertion to show
  interaction with the repo-ng repository.
* examples: Added arduino/analog-reading-consumer.cpp and the related
  Arduino sketch examples/arduino/analog-reading.
* examples: Make test-encode-decode-benchmarks use NDN-CPP Lite to test C.
* examples: Removed test-encode-decode-forwarding-entry and
  test-publish-async-ndnx because NDNx support is deprecated.
* Unit tests: Added test-der-encode-decode tests for CertificateExtension.
* Unit tests: In test-interest-methods, added ExcludeMatches.

Deprecated
* Deprecated support for NDNx and binary XML. See WireFormat::ENABLE_NDNX above.
* In Face, deprecated registerPrefix where onInterest is type OnInterest. Use the
  registerPrefix where onInterest is OnInterestCallback so you can call face.putData().

Bug fixes
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/2758 ControlParameters with empty name not properly encoded.

NDN-CPP v0.6 (2014-12-23)

* Fix bug for encoding/decoding the TLV Interest PublisherPublicKeyLocator.

NDN-CPP v0.4 (2014-02-27)
-------------------------

Changes
* Changed the default wire format to TlvWireFormat.
* In ./configure, added option --enable-binary-xml=yes to revert to Binary XML.
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1249. Support TLV FinalBlockId.

Deprecated
* Name: Deprecated appendFinalSegment. Use MetaInfo.setFinalBlockID.

* Sha256WithRsaSignature: get/setDigestAlgorithm as deprecated.  (This is
  implicit in the class Sha256WithRsaSignature.)
* MetaInfo: Deprecated get/setTimestampMilliseconds: Use the
  application-specific content to store a timestamp.

Bug fixes
* Name: Fix bug in append to explicitly make a Component to call append(Component).
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1247 Use new TLV type codes to not

Deprecated
* Interest: Deprecated getAnswerOriginKind.  Use getMustBeFresh.
* Interest: Deprecated setAnswerOriginKind.  Use setMustBeFresh.
* Interest: Deprecated getPublicKeyLocator.  If the interest has a public key locator, its keyLocator has
  type ndn_KeyLocatorType_KEY_LOCATOR_DIGEST and the key data has the digest.
* Interest: Deprecated constructors which take nonce and PublisherPublicKeyDigest.  If needed, use the constructor
  which takes a KeyLocator instead of the deprecated PublisherPublicKeyDigest.
